# LEVEL 3: ðŸ“¦ Parcels

## Overview

We have parcels to ship through the galaxy (yay!) and we want to know *how many*
vehicles of each kind we would need to ship those parcels.

## Expected behavior

Process the `input.json` to obtain the same vehicles count as in `output.json`.

## Caveats

- Sizes are in centimeters.
- Weights are in kilograms.

_May the force be with you_
