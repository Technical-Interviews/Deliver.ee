# LEVEL 5: ðŸ“± Grand finale

## Overview

This level is a bit different: we want to build a mobile UI for our couriers.

The UI details can be found in the `specs` folder.

You can use _any_ CSS framework, but please use one.

You can use *Vue.js* or *React* as a front-end framework.

## Expected behavior

The UI has to consume and display the data inside `input.json`

The UI has to be made of HTML/CSS/Javascript.

## Caveats

Since this is a test, the UI is only meant to display the data.

There is no form nor any persistence layer to think about.

Feel free to use any existing libraries.

_May the force be with you_
