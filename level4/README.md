# LEVEL 4: ðŸš¦ Dispatch

## Overview

We want to *organize and assign* our delivery tasks to our couriers fleet.

We need to match *their schedule* with the *time slot* of each delivery task.

We also need to assign the tasks according to each courier's allowed zones.

The tasks have to be ordered (start_at) for each couriers.

## Expected behavior

Process the `input.json` to obtain the same results as in `output.json`.
