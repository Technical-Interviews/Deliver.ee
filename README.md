## Instructions

### No fork / No PR

Instead, please clone this repository on your workstation, commit locally and send back
your completed challenges as a compressed repository archive. (hint: use `git archive`)

### No over-engineering

It's perfectly suitable to use existing gems in those challenges, who likes to reinvent the wheel?

You can load a custom Gemfile in each level with the help of Bundler.

### No under-engineering

`puts File.read('output.json')` won't be accepted.

### Comments

Blocks, classes, methods, modules, delegates...

Please justify your choices by commenting your craft.

## Expectations

- All the levels are optionals, the purpose here is to evaluate your knowledge and see how you solve problems.
- It is expected that your Ruby code runs at least on MRI 2.2 or above.
- Keep in mind that your code has to be readable by both machines and humans.

_May the force be with you_
